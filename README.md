hey there ! 
the **generator.py** file is the file you're looking for!
this will not only generate you passwords that are strong but also can hash the password, save it, and also will dehash it for you (if dehashing is a real term XD).
this code was made with the help of chatgpt (not all of it!)..

***note***
**just in case of dehahsing remember the passphrase you gave as an input while hashing/generating so that the code won't give you false positives or won't stop saying 'invalid passphrase'**
